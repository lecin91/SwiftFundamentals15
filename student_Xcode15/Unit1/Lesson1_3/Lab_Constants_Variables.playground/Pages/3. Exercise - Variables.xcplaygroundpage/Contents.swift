## Exercise - Variables
 
 Declare a variable `schooling` and set it to the number of years of school that you have completed. Print `schooling` to the console.

var schooling = 14
print(schooling)

//:  Now imagine you just completed an additional year of school, and update the `schooling` variable accordingly. Print `schooling` to the console.
schooling = 15
print(schooling)

//:  Does the above code compile? Why is this different than trying to update a constant? Print your explanation to the console using the `print` function.
print("The code compiles because 'schooling' is declated a variable which allows the value to be updated. If it would have been declared with 'let' (constant), we wouldn't be able to make a change after assigning a value. It would create a compilation error.")
